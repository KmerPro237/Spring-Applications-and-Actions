# What is MongoDB?

  - MongoDB is a widely-used, open-source NoSQL database management system. It falls under the category of document-oriented databases, which means it stores data in flexible, JSON-like BSON (Binary JSON) documents instead of traditional table-based relational database structures.

    ## Key features and characteristics of MongoDB include:

      ### Document-Oriented:
      - MongoDB stores data in flexible, schema-less documents. Each document is a JSON-like object with key-value pairs, allowing for dynamic and nested data structures.
      
      ### Scalability:
      - MongoDB is designed to scale horizontally by adding more servers to your MongoDB database. This makes it well-suited for handling large amounts of data and high traffic.
