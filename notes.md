# Main points learnt throughout development

### Servers vs Servlets in Java context

#### - Servers
- A server is a program that provides services to other programs or devices, either in the same computer or over a computer network. The term server can refer to hardware or software, or both.
- A server handles the whole JAVA EE. EJBs, Servlets, JSPs, etc. are all part of the JAVA EE.

#### - Servlets 
- On the other hand, a servlet is a Java programming language class that is used to extend the capabilities of servers that host applications accessed by means of a request-response programming model. Although servlets can respond to any type of request, they are commonly used to extend the applications hosted by web servers. They handle requests, perform server-side processing and generate dynamic contents for web-applications.
- A servlet-container supports only the servlet API (including JSP, JSTL)
